# Godot Fade Scene Transition

## Overview

This project shows how to easily setup a scene transition effect in which
when a scene loades it fades in and before loading the next scene the current 
fades out and the same process restats in the next scene. 

It was tested on **Godot 4.4.1**. It should work on some previous versions though.
